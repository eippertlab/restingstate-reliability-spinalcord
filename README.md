# restingstate-reliability-spinalcord

The code in this repository is associated with the manuscript [" "]() and the corresponding dataset (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004386; note that the dataset is currently only accessible to reviewers, but will be made publicly available when the manuscript is published).

This repository contains code the preprocessing and analysis codes to assess reliability of spinal cord resting-state networks as presented in above-mentioned manuscript. Note that the functions are organized following the organization of the manuscript.
