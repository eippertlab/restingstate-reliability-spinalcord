# restingstate-reliability-spinalcord

This repository is associated with the preprint [" "]() and the corresponding dataset (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004386; note that the dataset is currently only accessible to reviewers, but will be made publicly available when the manuscript is published in a journal).

This repository contains the preprocessing and analysis code needed to assess the reliability of spinal cord resting-state networks as presented in above-mentioned preprint. Note that the functions are organized according to the organization of the manuscript.
